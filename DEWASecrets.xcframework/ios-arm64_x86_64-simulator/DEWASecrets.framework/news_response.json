            "details": "<p>Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) is keen to ensure the security and sustainability of water in Dubai. This is in line with DEWA&rsquo;s commitment to this national priority and to realise the 6th Goal of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), &lsquo;Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all&rsquo;. DEWA is committed to creating a positive impact that ensures the sustainability of resources and a brighter future for current and future generations. This is especially important in light of the increasing global water crisis.</p><p>In keeping with the unprecedented economic growth in Dubai, the significant growth in population, and the steady increase in demand for water, DEWA is building water production plants based on Sea Water Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) technology. These plants require less energy than Multi-Stage Flash distillation (MSF) plants, making them a more sustainable choice for water desalination. By 2030, DEWA aims to produce 100% of desalinated water using clean energy and waste heat. DEWA&rsquo;s total production capacity has reached 490 Million Imperial Gallons per Day (MIGD) of desalinated water, including 63 MIGD using Reverse Osmosis (RO).</p><p>&ldquo;DEWA is guided by the directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to enhance water supplies in Dubai from sustainable sources and achieve the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 and the Dubai Net Zero Carbon Emissions Strategy 2050 to provide 100% of Dubai&rsquo;s total power capacity from clean energy sources by 2050. DEWA has a comprehensive approach to ensure the sustainability of water resources in line with the Dubai Integrated Water Resource Management Strategy 2030, which focuses on enhancing water resources and using cutting-edge technologies and innovative solutions,&rdquo; said HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, MD &amp; CEO of DEWA.</p><p>&ldquo;DEWA adopts three pillars to ensure the sustainability of water production. These are based on using clean solar power to desalinate seawater using Reverse Osmosis (RO) technologies, which use less energy than MSF plants. Excess water is stored in aquifers and pumped back into the water network when needed. This innovative integrated model protects the environment and is a sustainable economic solution. It also emphasises Dubai&rsquo;s ability to anticipate and shape the future. We ensure the continuation of 100% availability of DEWA&rsquo;s services according to the world&rsquo;s highest levels of availability, reliability, efficiency, and sustainability thanks to our state-of-the-art infrastructure. DEWA relies on innovation, the latest tools to anticipate the future, sound scientific planning, and seamless, swift, and effective operation of the smart grid. DEWA has achieved competitive results that surpass prominent European and American companies in terms of efficiency and reliability. In 2022, water network losses were reduced to 4.5% compared to around 15% in North America,&rdquo; added Al Tayer.</p><p>Water reservoirs</p><p>The water reservoirs we are building help increase the water flow and raise the volume of the Emirate&rsquo;s water reserve to meet the growing demand and increase the efficiency and reliability of water networks to support the sustainable development of Dubai. The storage capacity is currently 882 MIG. The water reservoir in the Lusaily area in Dubai has a storage capacity of 60 million imperial gallons (MIG), alongside the existing one, which stores 120 MIG of desalinated water. DEWA is working on three other reservoir projects in Nakhali, Hassyan and Hatta. With the completion of these projects, the storage capacity will increase to 1,152 MIG of desalinated water.</p><p>The World&rsquo;s Largest Solar Energy-Powered Desalination Plant</p><p>DEWA&rsquo;s Hassyan desalination project based on the Independent Water Producer (IWP) model is the largest of its kind in the world for water production based on Sea Water Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) technology using solar energy. It is DEWA&rsquo;s first IWP model project. The 180 Million Imperial Gallon per Day (MIGD) Sea Water Reverse Osmosis project has an investment of AED 3.357 billion (USD 914 million). Its capacity will increase to 670 MIGD in 2027 with the completion of this project.</p><p>The Largest Single-Site Water Desalination Facility in the World</p><p>DEWA&rsquo;s Jebel Ali Power and Desalination Complex is the largest single-site water desalination facility in the world, with a production capacity of 490 MIGD, which is equivalent to 2,227,587 cubic metres per day.</p><p>SCADA systems</p><p>In 2023, DEWA launched its third phase of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) Centre for both water transmission and distribution at Al Ruwaiyah BMC building. This is part of its efforts to achieve digital transformation using state-of-the-art operational technology, which includes real-time hydraulic modelling, training simulation system and advance reporting tools. This enables it to monitor the water network in Dubai remotely around the clock, including the water transmission pipelines, pumping stations and reservoirs sprawling over 3,000 kilometres. This has been achieved by installing over 10,000 smart devices. DEWA is currently implementing the District Metering Areas (DMA) at the distribution level and regularly expanding the transmission network and key distribution assets. </p><p>Smart Grid Strategy</p><p>The Smart Grid that DEWA is implementing, with total investments of AED 7 billion, is an integral part of DEWA&rsquo;s strategy to develop state-of-the-art infrastructure for managing facilities and services according to smart and integrated systems using disruptive technologies and Fourth Industrial Revolution applications. These include AI, drones, blockchain technology, Internet of Things (IoT), and more. The Smart Grid is among the key success factors of smart cities, as it ensures the seamlessness and availability of round-the-clock integrated and connected services.</p><p>The Smart Grid ensures two-way communication between the utility and the customer and allows monitoring of various components of the electricity and water networks. The Smart Grid will provide advanced features, including automated decision-making and interoperability across the entire electricity and water network to ensure smooth, quick, and effective functioning.</p><p>DEWA&rsquo;s Smart Grid Strategy 2021 &ndash; 2035 includes six main themes: Foundational Capabilities; Grid Automation; Smart Energy Solutions and Green Mobility; Smart Water; Smart Grid Artificial Intelligence; and Innovative Value-Added Services.</p><p>Smart meters</p><p>Smart meters are the backbone of the smart grid, and one of the pillars of DEWA&rsquo;s digital transformation. They raise operational efficiency and reduce losses. All active traditional meters for electricity and water in Dubai have been converted into smart meters. Smart meters provide many advantages for customers to control their consumption proactively and digitally without contacting DEWA. DEWA&rsquo;s Smart Meters Analysis and Diagnosis Centre monitors the smart meters remotely every 15 minutes.</p><p>Leading programmes and initiatives</p><p>As part of the smart grid strategy, DEWA has launched several pioneering programmes and initiatives, including the Smart Grid Data Governance Platform, to ensure compliance with all data policies and procedures. This ensures best practices in accountability, decision-making structure, data management and stewardship. The Smart Grid Data Governance platform manages data as an asset, and defines and approves data strategies, policies, standards, procedures and metrics.</p><p>Among the programmes launched by DEWA under the umbrella of the smart grid is an Automatic Smart Grid Restoration System (ASGR), the first of its kind in the MENA region, to increase the control, management, and monitoring of its power network. The system works around the clock without any human intervention. It uses a smart, innovative, and central system that locates the fault in the power network, isolates it, and automatically restores the service. This improves grid automation, fault detection and retrieval of connections.</p><p>In 2022, DEWA launched the Big Data and Analytics platform to integrate smart grid applications and operational technologies, among others. This enables the processing of large amounts of data and provides fact-based analytics and forecasting for current and future projects. The platform contributes to improving the operations and management of assets and smart meters, thus improving the experience of stakeholders and enhancing their happiness.</p><p>The &lsquo;High-Water Usage Alert&rsquo; service, supported by the smart grid detects any leaks in the water connections after the meter. The smart meter system sends instant notifications to customers if the smart meter system detects any unusual increase in consumption, so that they can quickly repair the internal connections, or any leaks in the water connections with the help of a specialised technician, and perform the necessary maintenance work to reduce waste.</p>",

The transition to using renewable energy sources to desalinate sea water is a national priority for UAE organisations, and enhances the UAE&rsquo;s leadership in adopting clean and renewable energy sources.</p><p>Comprehensive approach</p><p>HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, MD &amp; CEO of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), said that Dubai has a comprehensive approach for the sustainability of water resources by increasing water desalination capacity using the latest and most efficient technologies to reduce carbon emissions. He noted that DEWA is building water desalination plants using Sea Water Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) technology, which is more efficient and requires less energy than Multi-Stage Flash distillation (MSF) plants. This reduces carbon emissions and supports the UAE&rsquo;s efforts in climate work and reducing global warming. This is one of the pillars of the agenda for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 28), which the UAE hosted at Expo City Dubai.</p><p>&ldquo;In line with the vision and directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to provide the best facilities for the best city in the world, we at DEWA, work to provide an advanced and integrated infrastructure for energy and water that keeps pace with the growing development path of Dubai and meets the growing demand for electricity and water services. This meets the requirements of the comprehensive sustainable development plans and supports the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan. As part of our efforts to enhance water security in Dubai using sustainable sources, we recently signed the Water Purchase Agreement and Shareholder Agreement for the 180 MIGD Hassyan Phase 1 Independent Water Producer project, with an investment of AED 3.357 billion. This project will be the world&rsquo;s largest solar energy-powered desalination plant. It supports the Dubai Integrated Water Resource Management Strategy 2030, which focuses on enhancing water resources and using cutting-edge technologies and innovative solutions,&rdquo; added Al Tayer.</p><p>Al Tayer explained that DEWA aims to increase its SWRO production capacity to 303 MIGD by 2030. The desalinated water production capacity will reach 730 MIGD in 2030. According to DEWA&rsquo;s strategy, 100% of desalinated water will be produced by a clean energy mix that uses renewable energy and waste heat by 2030. This will allow Dubai to exceed global targets for using clean energy to desalinate water.</p><p>How does SWRO work?</p><p>Nasser Lootah, Executive Vice President of Generation at DEWA, explained that SWRO is a highly efficient technology for seawater desalination. This technology reverses the regular osmosis process, where molecules of a liquid pass from a solution of low concentration to a solution of high concentration through a semi-permeable membrane. In sea water reverse osmosis, high pressure is applied to the sea water to force the water through the semi-permeable membrane, leaving salts behind. </p><p>Advantages of reverse osmosis</p><p>Reverse osmosis technology has several advantages, making it an ideal choice compared to other water desalination technologies. One of its key features that it decouples water production from the dependency on a conventional power plant, thus improving its operational efficiency. Such decoupling enhances operational efficiency and supports the strategic move towards clean energy. Moreover, reverse osmosis plant uses less energy compared to other water desalination technologies such as flash distillation, thereby reducing emissions, environmental impact and costs. Reverse osmosis is highly effective, which makes it a reliable and sustainable solution to produce pure water from various sources, such as sea or underground water. Additionally, reverse osmosis allows for quick and efficient seawater desalination, which makes it suitable for emergency conditions and areas that suffer from water shortages.</p><p>DEWA currently has two SWRO plants with a production capacity of 63 MIGD. DEWA&rsquo;s total production capacity of desalinated water is 490 MIGD</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

DEWA promotes the adoption of a responsible lifestyle by following sustainable practices. These include enhancing the efficiency of electricity and water consumption, limiting waste, reducing the consumption of plastic materials, and reusing and recycling plastic.</p><p>&ldquo;We are working to consolidate the leadership of the UAE in climate action and biodiversity, as the UAE is one of the first countries in the region to pay great attention to protecting the environment and addressing the consequences of climate change by adopting green policies and launching pioneering initiatives in this vital sector, in addition to taking measures to address the root causes of plastic pollution and promote the transition towards a circular economy. Our commitment to sustainability is an extension of the legacy of the late Founding Father Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, and in support of the directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, for smart investment in our natural wealth to create a sustainable future for generations to come. We are keen to achieve the environmental, social, and economic aspects of sustainability, to support the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 and the Dubai Net Zero Carbon Emissions Strategy 2050 to provide 100% of the energy production capacity from clean energy sources by 2050, and the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030. DEWA is committed to strengthening the position of the UAE on the indicators of achieving the global sustainable development goals, and supporting its efforts to be one of the first countries in the world to achieve Net-Zero. This is especially important in the Year of Sustainability in the UAE under the theme &lsquo;Today for Tomorrow&rsquo;, during which the country hosted COP28 at Expo City Dubai. This also reflects the growing awareness of the correlation between the world&rsquo;s climate and its biodiversity,&rdquo; said HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, MD &amp; CEO of DEWA.</p><p>DEWA&rsquo;s efforts have contributed to reducing net carbon dioxide emissions in Dubai by 19% in 2022 compared to 2010.</p><p>&ldquo;Climate change impacts food production and security.
